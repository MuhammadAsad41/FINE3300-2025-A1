FINE3300 (Fall 2025) Assignment 1 - Muhammad Syed
This is Muhammad Syed's Assignment 1 for the course FINE3300 - Python for Finance Professionals. This contains my Mortgage Calculator & Currency Converter Code Files. 
For Question 1, I created a mortgage payment class & wrote the code to calculate the different mortgage payments asked for in the question. 
For Question 2, I created a Exchange Rates class and wrote the code for it. 
Note: In the Exchange Rate answer, I have designed my code in a way that it looks out for both csv & xlsx (excel) files as when I was downloading the exchange rate sheet from Canvas, it was opening up as a numbers (Mac's Excel App) file & that was corrputing the file thus, making it unreadable. I tried conversion from numbers to csv & other formats but nothing was working out thus, I had to write the code in a way that it would detect either one which resulted in the code working out as desired. This was a technical issue I faced on my mac.
